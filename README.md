Ar Portal Revived

This repository is an attempt to recreate the Ar Portal in a form as close as possible to
its original, based on archival data. It's still a work in progress, so there may be dead links
and other such problems. In addition, there is some data that's missing entirely that I haven't
been able to recover -- for example, the original data for the Ar Tonelico 2 Flash Cosmospheres.
If you have any data pertaining to the old Ar Portal, or know where it might be found, please
file a pull request or issue -- I'd really appreciate it!

Special thanks to:
Aquagon (for the original archive)
Internet Archive (for some data the original archive missed)
https://exapico.freetzi.com/ (for some data that wasn't in either archive)
